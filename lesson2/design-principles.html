                Hick's law is a psychological principle which states that the more options 
                are available to a person, the longer it will take for him or her to make a 
                decision about which option is best.
                A design principle known as “K.I.S.S.” (“Keep It Short and Simple”) became 
                recognized in the 1960s for its effectiveness in this regard. Echoing Hick's 
                Law, K.I.S.S. states that simplicity is the key for a system to work in the 
                best way. In some environments, K.I.S.S. gets translated as “Keep It Simple 
                Stupid”.
                I chose this website because there is one button on the homepage, which is to 
                shop sunglasses. Within the options of sunglasses there are very few to choose 
                from. The website is very simple and easy to navigate, I believe it follows Hick's 
                Law very well.

            <h3>Repetition</h3>

                The use of repetition across a website, document or other medium helps to 
                unify a layout, and ensure consistency. Repetition can be obvious or subtle 
                in the way that you use it. For example, a colour scheme repeated, a consistent 
                header or the same fonts. 
                It's important to note that using the same, consistent design builds trust 
                with the user. Having a messy, unconsistent design is a sure-fire way to make 
                a person doubt the legitimacy of your brand.
                I chose mubasic as my example because throughout the website they use the same 
                colors and design techniques. Which makes it very nice to look at and really 
                easy to use.

            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>

                White space or negative space is simply unmarked space in the design. It is 
                the space between the layouts, lines of paragraphs, between paragraphs, between 
                different UI elements and so on. White space does not literally mean an empty 
                space with a white background. It can be of any color, texture, patterns or even 
                a background image.
                Using white space and a clean design can do many things for the user such as improved 
                comprehension, more focus and attention, as well as a increased interaction rate.
                I chose google as an example because their design is so simple and easy to understand.
                Their homepage is almost all white space and with a search bar in the center. It's very
                straight forward to understand that all you have to do is enter somethin into the search 
                bar and press enter.
