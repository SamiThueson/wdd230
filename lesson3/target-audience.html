        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience for this website will be mostly those in the community.
            Farmerville is not a very big town and not many people visit it. Though there are 
            those who come to enjoy the lake when the season is right. 
            This website will be for those who are looking for information about the 
            town and the different events or businesses.
        </p>
